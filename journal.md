__Day 3__:

We went over basic network topologies by size and connections. After reading an article about this we did an exercise on the whiteboard to â€ est our knowledge.

For practising what we just learnt we connected to the Computer Science class raspberry pies via ssh like this:
`ssh pi@192.168.4.150`

We ssh'ed from that machine to another one with the same command. Also, we practised more bash scripting by creating a file with our name with CLI text editor `nano`.
